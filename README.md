# Movie Analysis Project

This project analyzes movies with above-average IMDb ratings from the past decades from different perspectoves. The source data is initially stored in Excel, then they are processed using SQL and Power BI.

There are two ways to view the analysis.

### 1️⃣ SQL and Power BI version

### 
1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).
2. Run `movies_database.sql` to create the database and import data.
3. Run `movies_analysis.sql` to perform the analysis.
4. Done! You can now query the data.

- **Open the `movies.pbix` file in Power BI**
